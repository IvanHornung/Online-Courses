%{As of early 2018, Usain Bolt holds the world record in the men's 100-meter dash. 
It is 9.58 seconds. What was his average speed in km/h?  Assign the result to a variable called }%

dash_distance_m = 100;
bolt_record_s = 9.58;
hundred = (dash_distance_m/bolt_record_s)*(1000^-1)*(60^2)

marathon_km = 42.195;
%convert hour:min:sec into decimal format
hours = 2+1*60^-1+39*60^-2;
marathon = marathon_km/hours
